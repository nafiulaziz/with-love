		 	Joyee.

			 From the moment you came, I have found many reasons to be grateful—not just for who you are, but for how you have quietly helped me grow. Knowing you has changed me in ways I never expected. You have influenced me spiritually, guiding my heart toward more patience, reflection, and sincerity, and in your own gentle way, you have brought me closer to Allah. That is something I will always hold deep gratitude for.<br>

Mentally, you have helped me see life with greater clarity and purpose. Your kindness, intelligence, and steady support have encouraged me to become a better person. You inspire me to think deeper, act wiser, and carry myself with more intention. The positivity you bring into my life has made my world feel lighter and more meaningful.

I appreciate how understanding and trustworthy you are, and I truly admire your strength, compassion, and the goodness you naturally share with others. Sometimes people enter our lives and leave them unchanged—but you have left mine better than you found it.

I feel sincerely thankful to know you. The growth I see within myself is, in many ways, connected to your presence in my life, and that is a gift I do not take lightly.
