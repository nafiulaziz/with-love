				Getting to know you has been a quiet discovery filled with moments I genuinely admire. There is something unforgettable about your eyes—calm, expressive, and effortlessly captivating. The way your hair falls so naturally suits you, and when you wear a saree, you carry it with such grace that it is hard not to notice.<br><br>

Your smile has a warmth that makes any moment feel lighter, and your presence often brings a quiet sense of comfort. I especially like the simple scenes—watching you enjoy your coffee or tea, or the little happiness on your face when there is a brownie nearby. It is these small, unspoken details that make you uniquely you.<br><br>

More than anything, I admire your confidence, your natural charm, and the effortless way you leave a positive impression wherever you go. Being around you feels easy, refreshing, and genuinely inspiring, and I find myself appreciating these qualities more each day.<br>
